## Design Patterns used on this Project

### Singleton as a Creational Pattern
 
It makes sure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Since the instantiation process is controlled by a class, the class has the flexibleness to alter the instantiation process.
 
### Composite Pattern as a Structural Pattern
 
It has a recursive composition. It composes objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
 
### Template Design as a Behaviour Pattern
 
It provides a skeleton for performing any variety of algorithm or an operation, and it allows the sub-classes to re-define a part of the logic.
